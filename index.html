    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Effective Date: 1/1/2024
    </p>
    <p>
        At RunMemo, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>No Data Collection: We do not collect, store, or share personal data.</li>
        <li>Local Storage: Your notes are stored entirely on your personal device(s).</li>
        <li>User Control: Deleting the app permanently erases your notes.</li>
        <li>Changes to Privacy Policy: Updates will be communicated via the app or website.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you opt in to AI analysis of your notes, as part of our use of OpenAI's developer platform, certain prompts and responses may be temporarily stored on OpenAI's systems for up to 30 days to help detect and prevent abuse. We have configured our OpenAI settings to disable sharing of data for model training; however, OpenAI may still retain recent data for security and operational purposes. After that retention period, any such data is deleted unless otherwise required by law. Even where you opt in to AI analysis of your Notes, you can selectively tag a Note "Do Not Process through AI" and it will not be shared with OpenAI. We remain committed to protecting your privacy and only share with OpenAI the information necessary to deliver our services while complying with their policies and safeguards.
